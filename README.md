# esper.js

> A low-level WebGL rendering framework.

### Motivation

The central motivation for esper.js is to provide a high-level 3D rendering framework without completely abstracting the WebGL API. To ensure ease of use

esper.js provides a suite of classes that encapsulate central 3D WebGL constructs. This framework is suited for projects requiring a high degree of configurability and requires familiarity with WebGL.
